# 3DPrinterKillSwitch

What is it? Nothing yet - but the idea is that 3D Printer Kill Switch will be an autonomous DIY system to kill your printer if it sees a thermal run away, or a smoke detector.

The solution will provide you with detailed information such as

Schematics, Software, Hardware, STL files for packages

- Based on ESP (Arduino compatible MicroController)
- Sensors / thermister support to add secondary thermisters on the bed / hotend
- Smoke Sensor
- Interface to set heat limit on the different sensors
- Custom delay before poweroff

And maybe more.. :-)
